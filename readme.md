#Web Services Development Assignment - API for a sensor-based occupancy detection system for a child seat in a vehicle
This project provides an API for the back-end required for my 4th year project. The 4th year project is a child detection system which can monitor the presence of a child while in a car seat. The system will consist of a mobile application, a web application, a back-end database and a sensor component which will relay data to the mobile device. The mobile application will be used by the parents/care-givers and will connect to the sensor component. On entering the vehicle the mobile app will connect to the sensor module. The user can monitor the sensor data via the app, i.e., how hot or cold it is in the vicinity of the car seat or if the child is still secure on their car seat. The user will receive a notification if they move out of range of the sensor component while the sensor module detects the presence of a child. The web application will be used by authorised users to remotely monitor the state of a sensor device during a journey. The purpose of the system is to provide parents and guardians with information regarding the comfort and safety of the child in their care.
